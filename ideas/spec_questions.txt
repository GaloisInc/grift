* Page 51 of the privilege spec says, "The sstatus register is a subset of the
  mstatus register. In a straightforward implementation, reading or writing any field
  in sstatus is equivalent to reading or writing the homonymous field in mstatus."
  Does this mean sstatus is ALWAYS the same register as mstatus? If not, is the way
  it's being modeled in the MIT and Bluespec Haskell specs too specific?
