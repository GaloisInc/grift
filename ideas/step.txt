Idea for modeling entire step function semantics

Right now, we map the Operands (a list of BitVectors) to the operand
expressions (a list of expressions).

We could also map each BitLayout to a BVExpr (inside bv-sized), which would
enable us to capture the denotational semantics of the  decoding mechanism. That
would be pretty darn cool.
